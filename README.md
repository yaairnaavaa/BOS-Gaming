This repository is an example of how to create a game in BOS using any blockchain.

## How to implement the game in BOS?

A simple way to implement this type of games in BOS is by using animated images, which will be displayed depending on the activity that the Burrito is performing.

All the statistics will be stored in the smart contract from where we will also be retrieving the information from the NFTs and sending to update the information after performing any action.

The main configurations and methods to be called from BOS to successfully run this game will be shown below:
